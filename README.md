# 🎃 The Haunted House - Kotlin Lab Workbook 🎃

## Welcome, Brave Explorer!

You've discovered the **Haunted House Kotlin Lab Workbook**, an interactive Halloween-themed adventure that teaches essential Kotlin concepts through spooky exploration!

## 📚 Topics Covered

This comprehensive lab workbook teaches:

1. **Static Members and Companion Objects** - Learn Kotlin's approach to static members
2. **Data Classes** - Auto-generated `equals()`, `toString()`, `copy()` methods
3. **Interfaces** - Define contracts and enable polymorphism
4. **Enums** - Fixed sets of constants with properties and methods
5. **`.equals()` and `.copy()` Methods** - Manual vs automatic implementation
6. **Try-Catch Blocks** - Exception handling in a supernatural context
7. **Deep vs Shallow Copying** - Understanding reference semantics
8. **Pass by Reference & Shared References** - How objects are passed in Kotlin
9. **Nullable Types (`?`) and Elvis Operator (`?:`)** - Null safety features
10. **Explicit vs Implicit Type Declarations** - When to use each approach

## 🏚️ The Story

You are an explorer entering **Ravencroft Manor**, a haunted house filled with:
- 👻 Mischievous spirits
- 📦 Mysterious artifacts  
- 🕯️ Dangerous rituals
- 🚪 Rooms with varying danger levels

Your goal: Build your **Power Level** to 100 before your sanity drops to 0!

## 🎮 How to Use This Workbook

### Running the Code

1. **Open in Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA**
   - Create a new Kotlin file
   - Copy the entire contents of `HauntedHouseLabWorkbook.kt`

   - **Mode 3: Complete Exercises** - Practice challenges

### Structure of the Workbook

The code is organized into 11 major sections:

```kotlin
// SECTION 1: Enums - Room types
// SECTION 2: Interfaces - Supernatural behaviors  
// SECTION 3: Data Classes - Explorer and Spirit entities
// SECTION 4: Regular Classes - Manual equals/copy implementation
// SECTION 5: Companion Objects - Static members
// SECTION 6: Nullable Types - Ghost detection with null safety
// SECTION 7: Try-Catch - Handling supernatural exceptions
// SECTION 8: Deep vs Shallow Copy - Cloning explorers
// SECTION 9: References - Shared artifacts between explorers
// SECTION 10: Type Inference - Explicit vs implicit types
// SECTION 11: The Game - Everything combined!
```

## 📖 Learning Path

  - Common pitfalls highlighted
  - Best practices noted

## 🧪 Lab Exercises

At the end of the workbook, you'll find 8 exercises plus a bonus challenge:

1. Create a `TrapType` enum
2. Build a `Spell` data class
3. Implement an `Enchantable` interface
4. Add companion objects with factory methods
5. Practice nullable types and Elvis operator
6. Handle custom exceptions
7. Implement deep copy functionality
8. Demonstrate type inference best practices

**Bonus Challenge:** Extend the game with a new feature using 5+ concepts!

## 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes

After completing this lab, students will:

- ✅ Understand Kotlin's approach to static members
- ✅ Know when to use data classes vs regular classes
- ✅ Design flexible systems using interfaces
- ✅ Handle errors gracefully with try-catch
- ✅ Avoid common pitfalls with object references
- ✅ Write null-safe code
- ✅ Make informed decisions about type declarations

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Run the code frequently** - See immediate results
2. **Modify the examples** - Break things and fix them!
3. **Read error messages** - Kotlin's compiler is very helpful
4. **Use the IDE features** - Auto-completion and hints
5. **Have fun!** - The spooky theme makes learning enjoyable

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- **"Cannot find symbol"** - Check your imports
- **"Type mismatch"** - Review nullable vs non-nullable types
- **"Unresolved reference"** - Ensure all classes are defined
- **Game won't run** - Start with the main() function

## 🎃 Halloween Fun Facts in the Code

Look for these Halloween elements:
- Room danger levels (1-10)
- Spirit types (Friendly, Hostile, Mischievous, Neutral)
- Cursed artifacts
- Sanity system
- Portal to the Other Realm
- Ancient scrolls and rituals

## 📝 Assignment Ideas

1. **Add a Save/Load System** - Practice file I/O
2. **Create a Combat System** - Use inheritance
3. **Build a Map** - Practice collections
4. **Add Multiplayer** - Learn coroutines
5. **Create a GUI** - Integrate with Android Views

## 🏆 Completion Certificate

When you can:
- Explain all 10 concepts
- Complete all exercises
- Extend the game with a new feature
- Score 100+ Power Level in the game

You've mastered these Kotlin fundamentals! 🎉
